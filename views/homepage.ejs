        Why are we doing this? A lot of people have student loans. What makes us so special? Well, I'm not sure how to answer that. I don't find us to be particularly special and I couldn't give you any persuasive argument as to why to give to us.
        </p><p>
        All I can do is simply ask, and so I'm humbly asking for help. We live in a society that is often afraid to ask for help. To reach out to the people in our lives and say, "Hey, I need...", you fill in the blanks. There is no shame in asking. We've all needed help. The question is, "Are you strong enough to put it out there?".
        </p><p>
        I want to be clear. We are not down and out. We aren't out of work. We are not on the streets starving. Quite the opposite. Personally, I've never been happier in my life. We have been blessed tremendously with an awesome relationship. We are helping others in their's. We are getting out of debt. Life is great!
        </p><p>
        To others, you may question our tactics as a little unorthodox. But that's okay. You can talk about us :). It brings us great joy to challenge your thinking on life.
        </p><p>
        Don't give because you pity us or feel pressured to do so. Give if you want to and can afford it. Certainly don't go into debt to help us out of ours.
        </p><p>
        If we never receive a penny through this site, my sincere hope is that it helps someone consider what is means to graduate with $110,000.00 of student loan debt. For us it means an $1,100.00 a month payment that we will pay over the next 10 years. It's a lot. I don't know what the answer is for those that can't get financial aid and want their degree, but I hope is starts a conversation in our society about how to remedy this over-bearing burden on our graduates.
